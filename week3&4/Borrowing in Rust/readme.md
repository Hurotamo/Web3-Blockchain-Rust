Borrowing in Rust allows references to data without taking ownership. Borrowing can be either immutable or mutable.

Immutable Borrowing (&): Multiple immutable references are allowed, but you cannot modify the data.
Mutable Borrowing (&mut): Only one mutable reference to data is allowed at a time, ensuring no simultaneous modification from different parts of the code.
