Lifetimes are a way for Rust to track how long references are valid. This ensures that references do not outlive the data they point to, preventing dangling references.

Static Lifetime: A reference that is valid for the entire duration of the program.
Explicit Lifetimes: Sometimes, Rust can't infer the lifetime of a reference, and you'll need to explicitly specify it.
