Week 3-4: Ownership, Borrowing & Lifetimes in Rust

During these weeks, you'll dive into some of the most important concepts in Rust: Ownership, Borrowing, and Lifetimes. These concepts set Rust apart from many other languages because they ensure memory safety without needing a garbage collector

 Key Differences with Other Languages
No Garbage Collector: Rust manages memory manually using ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes. This is different from languages like Java or Python, which use garbage collection to manage memory.
Strict Borrowing Rules: Rust enforces strict rules around borrowing data to prevent issues like data races and dangling pointers, unlike languages with more relaxed memory management rules.
Memory Safety Without a Runtime: Rust achieves memory safety without needing a garbage collector or runtime checking, unlike languages like Java or Go.


 Final Thoughts
Mastering ownership, borrowing, and lifetimes is critical to becoming proficient in Rust. These concepts provide Rust's guarantees around memory safety and concurrency, which make it a unique and powerful language. Try experimenting with different combinations of mutable and immutable references and understand how Rust's lifetime annotations ensure safe code.

By the end of Week 4, you should feel comfortable with these fundamental concepts, which will be essential as you build more complex projects in Rust.
