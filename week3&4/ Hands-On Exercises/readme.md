Now that you have the concepts, let's practice with a few exercises:

Exercise 1: Ownership Transfer
Create a String variable, transfer its ownership to another variable, and try printing both variables (to understand ownership transfer).
Exercise 2: Borrowing (Immutable & Mutable)
Write a function that takes an immutable reference to a string and another function that takes a mutable reference. Modify the string in the mutable reference function and print it from the main function.
Exercise 3: Lifetimes and Functions
Write a function that returns the longest string from two string references, and add proper lifetime annotations.
Exercise 4: Strings and Vectors
Build a function that takes a vector of integers by reference and returns a new vector containing only the even numbers. Ensure that references to the original vector remain valid.
